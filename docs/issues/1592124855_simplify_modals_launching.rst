Simplify Modals Launching
=========================

Modals should be connected when launched, so that their data
loading methods are scheduled as well.


Validation Criteria
-------------------

- [ ] Modals should be closed by pressing the middle mouse button
  (i.e. wheel button)
- [ ] Modals shouldn't autobuild. Instead they should 'build' on launch.
