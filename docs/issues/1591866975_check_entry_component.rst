Check Entry Component
=====================

Entry component can be improved.
As of version 0.3.1 it is usable but the cursor positioning while 
writing and focusing it with the mouse can be made more intuitive.

- Mouse scrolling should be supported to go up and down inside
  the editor.
- Horizontal scrolling while pressing the shift key should be
  handled.
